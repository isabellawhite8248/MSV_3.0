public class Visualizer {

    //contains a back button to animation screen
    //carries out the animation at specific time intervals with specific dot groups
    //also contains an exit progra button
    //scrubbable time progress buttton with a pause play button, plays selected audio, dot arrays in the right place
    //scrubbing can be a workable feature - don't implement right away

    //after you are done with that class - go back - comment and reorganize code, write up the final read me and push to git with the previous msv versions
    //upload live line up and plot out simple animations for each and animate them yeahhhh bitch you finished
    //after you code them learn each on the guitar - then piano after yiruma kiss the rain - then singing then production

    //after you have all these down - record an acoustic and musically produced version of each
    //edit the videos - finish + brand your company with a website
    //finish both websites
    //finish leet and cracking the coding interview

    //you'll have both brands launched -- work on writing your own music and figuring out a live setup - rehearse in the dorm room - then look for some open mics and start performing
    //but upload one video once a week - either a pre recorded one, OG music or a popular cover and try to go network at open mics or find a gig a week
